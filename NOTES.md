# Minimax algorithm implementation with logic

The  purpose and action of each part of the Minimax algorithm:

1. The algorithm begins by checking if the search has reached a terminal state or the maximum search depth.
2. If the current player is maximizing, the function tries to find the move with the highest value.
3. If the current player is minimizing, the function tries to find the move with the lowest value.
4. The function uses recursion to explore the game tree to the specified depth.
5. The heuristic function evaluates the game states at the leaf nodes of the game tree.
6. The algorithm alternates between maximizing and minimizing players at each level of the tree.

Some of the implemented helper functions:

1. **Heuristic Function**: This needs to be defined based on the game state attributes.
2. **Minimax Implementation**: We have structured the `minimax` function to call `heuristic`, `is_terminal`, `get_safe_moves`, and `apply_move` functions, which need to be implemented.
3. **Apply Move**: To simulate game states, implement a function that applies a move to the current game state and returns a new state.
4. **Terminal State Check**: Define a function that determines if a game state is terminal (either game over or a depth limit reached in the search).
5. **Safe Moves**: We have retained the logic to calculate safe moves as in the earlier code.

**Need to fine-tune the depth of the search and the heuristic evaluation.**


**Minimax-Algorithm Implementation:**

```python

def minimax(game_state: typing.Dict, depth: int, maximizingPlayer: bool) -> typing.Tuple[float, str]:
    # Base case: if we've reached the maximum depth or the game is over, evaluate the game state
    if depth == 0 or is_terminal(game_state):
        return heuristic(game_state), None

    if maximizingPlayer:
        # Initialize the best value to the lowest possible number
        value = NEGATIVE_INFINITY
        # Initialize the best move to None
        best_move = None
        # Explore all possible safe moves for the maximizing player
        for move_option in get_safe_moves(game_state):
            # Apply the move to get a new game state
            new_state = apply_move(game_state, move_option)
            # Recursively call minimax for the new state, decreasing the depth
            new_value, _ = minimax(new_state, depth-1, False)
            # Update the best value and move if the new value is better
            if new_value > value:
                value, best_move = new_value, move_option
        # Return the best value and move found for the maximizing player
        return value, best_move
    else:
        # Initialize the best value to the highest possible number
        value = POSITIVE_INFINITY
        # Initialize the best move to None
        best_move = None
        # Explore all possible safe moves for the minimizing player
        for move_option in get_safe_moves(game_state):
            # Apply the move to get a new game state
            new_state = apply_move(game_state, move_option)
            # Recursively call minimax for the new state, decreasing the depth
            new_value, _ = minimax(new_state, depth-1, True)
            # Update the best value and move if the new value is better for the minimizing player
            if new_value < value:
                value, best_move = new_value, move_option
        # Return the best value and move found for the minimizing player
        return value, best_move

```


Improving the heuristic function involves considering multiple factors that could contribute to the overall success of the Battlesnake. The score can also be a function of various attributes of the game state such as the current 
number of move options available, length of each snake, number of squares controlled, 
snake health, distance to nearest food etc.

```python
import copy
import math

# Constants for heuristic evaluation
POSITIVE_INFINITY = float('inf')
NEGATIVE_INFINITY = -float('inf')

# Helper function to calculate the Manhattan distance between two points
def manhattan_distance(a, b):
    return abs(a['x'] - b['x']) + abs(a['y'] - b['y'])

# Enhanced heuristic function
def heuristic(game_state: typing.Dict) -> float:
    my_snake = game_state['you']
    my_health = my_snake['health']
    my_head = my_snake['body'][0]
    my_length = len(my_snake['body'])
    
    # Start with a base score related to the snake's health
    score = my_health / 100.0
    
    # Reward having more body length (more resilience in the game)
    score += my_length
    
    # Reward having more available moves (more freedom to navigate)
    safe_moves = get_safe_moves(game_state)
    score += len(safe_moves) * 2  # Weighting freedom of movement higher

    # Calculate the distance to the closest food (shorter is better)
    if game_state['board']['food']:
        closest_food_distance = min(manhattan_distance(my_head, food) for food in game_state['board']['food'])
        score -= closest_food_distance / 10.0  # We subtract because less distance is better

    # Reward controlling more squares in the board (area control)
    # This is a placeholder for a function that would analyze the board and estimate area control
    # score += calculate_area_control(game_state) / 10.0
    
    # Penalize the proximity to other snakes (potential danger)
    for snake in game_state['board']['snakes']:
        if snake['id'] != my_snake['id']:
            # Consider the head of other snakes as dangerous areas
            score -= manhattan_distance(my_head, snake['body'][0]) / 20.0
    
    # The score should be a large positive number if the opponentâ€™s snake dies
    for snake in game_state['board']['snakes']:
        if snake['id'] != my_snake['id'] and snake['health'] == 0:
            score += POSITIVE_INFINITY / 2  # Use a large number but not infinity for practical reasons
    
    # The score should be a large negative number if your snake dies
    if my_health == 0:
        score += NEGATIVE_INFINITY / 2  # Use a large negative number but not negative infinity for practical reasons

    return score
```

Explanation:
- **Health**: The snake's current health is used as a base score, normalized to a smaller range.
- **Length**: The length of the snake is considered a good thing as it can be an advantage in head-to-head encounters.
- **Move Options**: The number of safe moves available is rewarded to encourage movement freedom.
- **Food Distance**: The distance to the nearest food item is penalized to encourage seeking food when necessary.
- **Area Control**: This is a placeholder for a potential function that would estimate how much area your snake controls. Controlling more area can be advantageous.
- **Proximity to Other Snakes**: Proximity to other snakes, especially their heads, is penalized as it represents potential danger.
- **Opponent's Death**: If an opponent snake dies, this is a highly positive event.
- **Own Death**: If your snake dies, this is a highly negative event.

We can also implement area control by analyzing the board and estimating the area that the snake effectively controls. It might be complex, and we can use pathfinding algorithms to predict where the snake can move in future turns.

One approach is to use a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to simulate how much area the snake can potentially reach, taking into account the positions of other snakes and the walls of the board.

```python

# Helper function to calculate the Manhattan distance between two points
def manhattan_distance(a, b):
    return abs(a['x'] - b['x']) + abs(a['y'] - b['y'])

# Helper function to check if a point is on the board
def is_point_on_board(point, width, height):
    return 0 <= point['x'] < width and 0 <= point['y'] < height

# Helper function to estimate the area of the board controlled by our snake
def calculate_area_control(game_state, head):
    board_width = game_state['board']['width']
    board_height = game_state['board']['height']
    # Create a grid to represent the board
    board_grid = np.zeros((board_width, board_height), dtype=int)
    
    # Mark the position of all snakes' bodies on the board
    for snake in game_state['board']['snakes']:
        for segment in snake['body']:
            # Ensure the body segment is on the board
            if is_point_on_board(segment, board_width, board_height):
                # Mark the segment as occupied
                board_grid[segment['x']][segment['y']] = 1

    # Perform a flood fill algorithm starting from our snake's head position
    # to determine the size of the area controlled
    area = 0
    queue = [head]
    directions = [{'x': 0, 'y': 1}, {'x': 1, 'y': 0}, {'x': 0, 'y': -1}, {'x': -1, 'y': 0}]
    while queue:
        current = queue.pop(0)
        for direction in directions:
            neighbor = {'x': current['x'] + direction['x'], 'y': current['y'] + direction['y']}
            if is_point_on_board(neighbor, board_width, board_height) and board_grid[neighbor['x']][neighbor['y']] == 0:
                board_grid[neighbor['x']][neighbor['y']] = 1  # Mark as visited
                area += 1
                queue.append(neighbor)
    return area

# The heuristic function
def heuristic(game_state: typing.Dict) -> float:
    my_snake = game_state['you']
    my_health = my_snake['health']
    my_head = my_snake['body'][0]
    my_length = len(my_snake['body'])
    
    # Initialize the score with the health ratio and length of our snake
    score = (my_health / 100.0) + my_length

    # Integrate the area control score into the heuristic
    area_control_score = calculate_area_control(game_state, my_head)
    score += area_control_score / 10.0  # Add the area control score to the heuristic with a weight
    
    # Penalize the proximity to other snakes (potential danger)
    for snake in game_state['board']['snakes']:
        if snake['id'] != my_snake['id']:
            distance_to_snake = manhattan_distance(my_head, snake['body'][0])
            # The closer the other snake's head, the higher the penalty
            score -= max(10 - distance_to_snake, 0) / 10.0

    # Encourage getting closer to food if health is below a certain threshold
    if my_health < 50 and game_state['board']['food']:
        closest_food_distance = min(manhattan_distance(my_head, food) for food in game_state['board']['food'])
        # The closer the food, the higher the score, especially when health is low
        score += 10 / (closest_food_distance + 1)

    return score


```

In this implementation, the calculate_area_control function uses a flood fill algorithm to estimate the area that the snake controls. It starts from the snake's head and counts how many empty squares are reachable, marking them in a grid as it goes to prevent counting the same square multiple times. The heuristic function then incorporates this area control score, along with other factors like health, length, and proximity to food and other snakes, to calculate a total score for the game state.



The problem in this code is how to avoid the opponent. 
- How to avoid opponent while taking the move. We have to check the safe move.
